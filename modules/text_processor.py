ChatterboxTTS Text Processing Module
====================================

OVERVIEW:
This module is the core text preprocessing system for ChatterboxTTS audiobook generation.
It handles intelligent text chunking, abbreviation replacement, and punctuation normalization
to prepare raw text for high-quality TTS synthesis.

MAIN COMPONENTS:
1. ABBREVIATION SYSTEM: Converts TTS-unfriendly abbreviations (Dr. -> Doctor)
2. TEXT CHUNKING: Breaks text into optimal chunks respecting sentence boundaries
3. PUNCTUATION NORMALIZATION: Standardizes quotes, adds missing periods
4. BOUNDARY DETECTION: Identifies chapter/paragraph breaks for silence insertion

CRITICAL ALGORITHM FIXES:
- Fixed sentence chunking to respect punctuation boundaries (not word counts)
- Enhanced dialogue handling to prevent quote corruption
- Improved abbreviation replacement with external file loading
- Added smart punctuation detection for precise silence timing

USAGE FLOW:
Text Input ‚Üí Abbreviation Replacement ‚Üí Punctuation Normalization ‚Üí 
Sentence Chunking ‚Üí Boundary Detection ‚Üí JSON Output for TTS

PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
Proper chunking prevents TTS model confusion and maintains voice consistency
across long audiobooks by preserving natural speech boundaries.

    CRITICAL CHUNKING ALGORITHM - Heart of the TTS preprocessing system
    ================================================================
    
    ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
    This function is the most important component for TTS quality. It breaks raw text 
    into optimal chunks that respect natural speech boundaries, preventing TTS model 
    confusion and maintaining consistent voice characteristics.
    
    CORE PRINCIPLE: SENTENCE BOUNDARIES FIRST, WORD COUNTS SECOND
    - Always prioritize complete sentences over arbitrary word limits
    - Break long sentences at natural pauses (punctuation hierarchy)
    - Combine short chunks to meet minimum requirements
    - Preserve semantic coherence and emotional consistency
    
    TEXT CHUNKING RULES (in priority order):
    1. Break at sentence boundaries (. ! ?) first (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
    2. If sentence > max_words, break at punctuation working backwards
    3. If no punctuation available, preserve sentence intact (coherence over limits)
    4. Ensure all chunks meet min_words requirement by combining small chunks
    
    PUNCTUATION HIERARCHY (for breaking overlong sentences):
    1. . ! ? (sentence boundaries) - handled at sentence level first
    2. ; (semicolon) - major pause, good break point
    3. ‚Äî ‚Äì (em/en dashes) - major pause, narrative breaks
    4. , (comma) - minor pause, last resort for breaks
    5. NO PUNCTUATION = preserve intact (maintains emotional/semantic unity)
    
    WHY THIS APPROACH:
    - Prevents choppy, robotic speech from mid-sentence breaks
    - Maintains narrative flow and character voice consistency  
    - Respects author's punctuation for natural pauses
    - Reduces TTS model confusion from incomplete thoughts
    - Essential for long-form audiobook quality
    
    PARAMETERS:
    - text: Raw input text to be chunked
    - max_words: Target maximum words per chunk (flexible for complete sentences)
    - min_words: Minimum words per chunk (enforced by combining)
