## Detailed Performance Analysis

### üîß Model Loading Performance
| Metric | Standard | Compiled | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Load Time | 8.96s | 5.83s | **+54% faster** |
| Memory Usage | 2.98GB | 2.98GB | No change |
| Compilation Time | N/A | ~0.5s | One-time cost |

**Analysis**: Significant improvement in model initialization, primarily due to optimized component loading and pre-compilation of neural networks.

### üó£Ô∏è Text Generation Performance
| Metric | Standard | Compiled | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Avg Time/Chunk | 2,750ms | 2,548ms | **+8% faster** |
| Throughput | 44.6 chars/s | 48.1 chars/s | **+8% faster** |
| Words/Second | 5.8 w/s | 6.3 w/s | **+8% faster** |

**Analysis**: Consistent performance improvement across all text generation metrics, indicating successful optimization of the TTS inference pipeline.

### üé§ Voice Encoding Performance
| Metric | Standard | Compiled | Change |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Avg Time | 45.9ms | 51.1ms | -10% slower |
| Min Time | 43.0ms | 44.4ms | -3% slower |
| Max Time | 50.8ms | 62.1ms | -22% slower |

**Analysis**: Unexpected slight regression in voice encoding. This is likely due to the high-level API (`prepare_conditionals`) including additional overhead that masks the core voice encoder improvements seen in isolated testing.
